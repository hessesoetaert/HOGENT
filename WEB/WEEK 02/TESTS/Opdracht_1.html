            FNAF 4

            In 1983, the success of Fredbear’s Family Diner spawns Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, a restaurant where animatronics could venture beyond the stage. Around this time, Emily and Afton developed springlock suits, which allowed employees to wear the animatronics as a suit, compressing their mechanisms with springs. They proved extremely dangerous, as the springs holding the locks could become disengaged, skewering the employee inside. Due to the success of these emergent technologies, William installed cameras in his home to watch his children, including his youngest son, who was deathly afraid of the Fredbear animatronic. During the youngest Afton's birthday, Afton’s older son Michael played a prank on his brother, placing his head in Fredbear’s mouth. To everyone’s shock, the animatronic clamped its jaw down on the young boy’s head, killing him.

            Five Night at Freddy's 4 features the earliest events depicted in FNAF’s video game titles. The player takes on the role of a child in their own bedroom. Over the course of five nights, the child is haunted by grotesque and terrifying manifestations of the FNAF animatronics, including Chica, Bonnie, Freddy, and Foxy. However, additional nights reveal a frightening version of the Fredbear animatronic, as well.

            Through unique minigames, a means through which early FNAF titles dispelled their lore, players learn that the child was actually Afton’s youngest son. Fans learn that the event in which Fredbear’s jaw clamped down and killed him is referred to as the Bite of '83 and that the incident led to the closure of Fredbear's Family Diner. Sometime around these events, William Afton killed his first victim, Henry Emily’s daughter, Charlotte. She is later revealed to possess the Puppet animatronic and become the protector of the souls of Afton’s later victims.

            Tales Of The Pizzaplex: The Mimic

            The FNAF book series often portrays the franchise's lore through parallel stories with changed names and locations. However, the Mimic storyline has broken into the video game series’ canon, making it necessary to add it to the lore timeline.

            The Mimic was an animatronic, consisting of only a head, torso, and arms, created by Fazbear Engineer Edwin Murray, who many fans believe to be a parallel to Henry Emily. Designed to mimic best practices, the animatronic learns through observation before mimicking the behavior. Edwin seemingly created the technology to program all of Fazbear Entertainment's animatronics and systems through teaching, which could streamline the development of characters, stories, and systems.
            The very first individual the animatronic mimicked was Edwin’s son, David. However, David’s death saw the creator turn on his creation, as the Mimic continued to impersonate David after death, reminding his father of his failure. Through a violent outburst from Edwin, the Mimic's core program, mimic1, learned violence, creating an important virtual entity for FNAF’s most recent storyline, the mimic1 virus. Edwin disappeared, and Fazbear employees were sent to recover his work. They discovered another team was there, and that they “fixed” the Mimic by attaching legs. The Mimic began to impersonate people's voices and lure employees to their deaths, hiding within the locations’ many experimental mascot suits. The Mimic was seemingly recovered by Fazbear Entertainment and used, years later, in the development of animatronics. (Can you see the parallel to William Afton lmao)

            FNAF 2

            Five Night at Freddy's 2 sees the player take on the role of Night Security Guard Jeremy Fitzgerald at a new Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location in 1987. Over the course of five nights, Jeremy must survive the roaming animatronics by wearing a Freddy mask when they enter the security office. The title sees the introduction of three new animatronics -- the Mangle, Balloon Boy, and the Puppet -- which players must keep in check alongside new versions of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy. Phone Guy, a mysterious individual calls Jeremy on the office phone each night, providing players with crucial information about the prior day’s events and the location's history.

            FNAF's Phone Guy later reveals that this specific location of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza is about to be the subject of a police investigation. On the fifth night, Phone Guy informs the player that the location is in lockdown, as an unspecified event during the day shift has made it so that no employees, even those who are no longer employed, can enter or leave the restaurant. FNAF 2’s minigames reveal that it was the site of multiple murders, each involving young children. The murderer is depicted as a Purple Man, with Phone Guy’s call on the sixth night implying his use of a yellow rabbit suit. It is revealed that the Puppet, possessed by Henry Emily's daughter Charlotte, places the victims' souls in the FNAF 1 animatronics, giving them life once again.

            Sister Location

            Sister Location’s place in Five Nights at Freddy's timeline is up for debate, but many (and myself) believe it runs nearly parallel to the original Five Nights at Freddy's game. The title’s unreliable AI assistant HandUnit states, “Due to the massive success, and even more so the unfortunate closing of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, it was clear that the stage was set -- no pun intended -- for another contender in children’s entertainment.” This is seemingly in reference to the Bite of ’87 in FNAF 2. The same incident is brought up in Night 1 of the original Five Nights at Freddy’s, by a returning source of guidance.

            Sister Location begins with William Afton being questioned about strange design choices in his new animatronics. Players take on the role of Michael Afton, the brother of FNAF 4’s victim and new overnight employee of Circus Baby’s Entertainment and Rental, a new venture that rents out animatronics for birthdays and events. The title features animatronics from the now-closed Circus Baby’s Pizza World, including Circus Baby, Funtime Foxy, Funtime Freddy, and Ballora the Ballerina. Michael is tasked with checking each animatronic across five nights and fixing various errors and glitches.

            Sister Location is the first FNAF title to allow movement; the player navigates the facility checking for maintenance tasks. However, it soon becomes the series’ first narrative adventure, as Michael allies with Circus Baby to avoid the other animatronics and free himself from a springlock suit. During the final night, Circus Baby instructs Mike to destroy her empty body after removing a chip from her arm containing “what is good” so that only the bad will be destroyed. Michael is tricked into entering the Scooping Room, where it is revealed that the “Circus Baby Voice” instructing Michael is actually a malevolent amalgamation called Ennard, who scoops Michael’s insides out, before entering his body and leaving the location. Sometime later, Ennard is vomited out of Michael’s body, but he somehow comes back to life. (The cause is very clearly remanent but I don’t think it’s confirmed how) Sister Location’s core minigame reveals that Circus Baby killed William Afton’s daughter, Elizabeth, who now possesses the animatronic.
            Even more lore
            (I think I reached the chartacter limit because it wasnt letting me add more to that section idk)

            FNAF 1

            Five Nights at Freddy's sees players in the role of Night Guard Mike Schmidt, later implied to be a returning Michael Afton. Over the course of five nights, Mike is offered guidance from a returning “Phone Guy”, who again relays the history of the restaurant’s checkered past. Due to the Bite of '87, FNAF 2's daytime incident, this location’s animatronics - Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy – are no longer allowed to wander the restaurant during the day. They are therefore permitted to explore at night to keep their motors from locking up.

            Newspaper clippings in the Five Nights at Freddy's restaurant hallway reveal that a man had lured five children into the back of the restaurant and killed them. The children's bodies were never found, but the restaurant quickly began to receive complaints of the animatronics emitting a strange odor. The fourth night’s message implies that “Phone Guy” has been killed by an animatronic. Following the unlockable Seventh Night, Schmidt (is fired for tampering with the animatronics and giving off a foul smell.

            FNAF 3

            Taking place roughly 30 years after Five Nights at Freddy's, FNAF 3 has players take on the role of an unnamed Security Guard at the Fazbear’s Frights Haunted Attraction. The attraction is meant to capitalize on the “ghost stories” that have spread about Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, and theories suggest that its protagonist is either Michael Afton or Henry Emily. Over the course of five nights, the guard must fend off a single enemy, Springtrap, who has emerged from a hidden room in the Fazbear’s Frights Attraction. The player is once again guided by a series of voicemail messages, which relay that the staff at Fazbear's Fright has discovered an old, deteriorated, and rabbit-like animatronic and tapes from the original Phone Guy.

            Phone Guy’s Tapes instruct employees on how to operate springlock suits, which allow characters to function as both animatronics and costumes for employees. The tapes also reveal a back room that is “always off camera” and should not be shown to customers. It is revealed through various minigames that William Afton’s corpse is inside Springtrap, having triggered its springlocks in the hidden back room. The malfunction was caused by a confrontation between Afton and the souls of his victims, whom the Puppet had placed in the original Five Nights at Freddy's animatronics during FNAF 2’s minigames.

            Springtrap remained in the room for 30 years but was released by Fazbear Fright’s employees. At the game’s conclusion, the protagonist attempts to destroy Afton by burning down the attraction but fails. FNAF 3's events led to what was originally meant to be the Five Nights at Freddy's series' final entry. However, the title would prove to be the kick-off for a brand-new era, as it introduced a location that would recur in FNAF titles to come.

            Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator

            In Pizzeria Simulator, the player is a franchisee of the freshly re-branded Fazbear Entertainment Inc. and runs a restaurant called Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza Place. The title sees the player-character, Michael Afton, tasked with preparing the restaurant for a “big party on Saturday” which requires investments in decorations and animatronics, as well as the completion of managerial tasks at night. Michael must also choose whether to salvage or dispose of mysterious animatronics that have been left outside the restaurant at the start of each day, an obligation of his contract under "Paragraph 4." These animatronics are Scrap Baby, which is the “bad part” of Circus Baby following her ejection from Ennard; Molten Freddy, the reconfigured Ennard animatronics; Lefty, a black bear animatronic housing the Puppet; and Scraptrap, a burnt and decaying Springtrap, following his escape from Fazbear’s Frights. During nighttime maintenance, Michael must survive attacks from the salvaged animatronics.

            In Pizzeria Simulator’s “Completion” ending, Michael successfully gathers all the souls of victims from past games. After a brief monologue, in which Scrap Baby asserts that she will use the souls to make Afton proud, she is interrupted by Henry Emily, the title’s true orchestrator. Henry burns down the restaurant, with Scrap Baby, Lefty, William Afton, Ennard, and Michael trapped inside, ending Afton’s legacy once and for all. He addresses Elizabeth, Charlotte, and William directly, saying their souls are now freed. He then addresses Michael, whom he believes will wish to die alongside them. The game concludes with the player being told that Fazbear Entertainment is no longer a corporate entity.

            Ultimate Custom Night

            Ultimate Custom Night has no true narrative, as it is actually a series of never-ending nightmares from the perspective of William Afton. The most widely accepted explanation for the title comes from the Fazbear Frights book series. In a short story thought to parallel the game’s canon, titled The Man In Room 1280, a burnt Afton, on the brink of death following Pizzeria Simulator, is kept alive by a malevolent entity. The entity keeps him alive in the hospital, despite his mortal injuries, forcing him to pay for his crimes by experiencing a recurring cycle in which he is killed by his own creations. The one responsible for Afton's torment is heavily theorized to be Cassidy, one of Afton’s earliest victims, whose spirit possesses the rare Golden Freddy animatronic in FNAF 1 and FNAF 2.

            Help Wanted

            Help Wanted, also called the Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience, is an in-universe VR game, meant to undo the damage caused by a "rogue indie developer", series creator Scott Cawthon. Fazbear Entertainment LLC, established in roughly 2030, first hired Silver Parasol Games as the development team for The Freddy Fazbear Virtual Experience, which made video games out of the “fake” tales that have been spread about Fazbear Entertainment's restaurants. In order to expedite the process, Fazbear Entertainment supplied the developers with old circuit boards and other technology from vintage animatronics to help with pathing for characters in the game. This released the Glitchtrap Virus, which many now believe to be the mimic1 virus, leading to the death of a playtester named Jeremy. It’s theorised that glitch trap tormented Jeremy while he was playtesting leading to his ultimate demise (DONT get all the Jeremy’s mixed up I think Scott just liked the name)

            A character called Tape Girl was tasked with finishing Jeremy’s work. However, she soon discovered the details of his incident through emails between Fazbear LLC and the indie developer, revealing their working together. Tape Girl decides to isolate pieces of the virus among various digital recording tapes. Within these files, she leaves messages for the player character, Vanessa, telling her that collecting all digital tapes will set the stage for Glitchtrap’s escape.

            During the Curse of Dreadbear DLC, Vanessa is led to find a bunny mask (V.A.N.N.I mask) , which results in her being possessed by the Glitchtrap virus. This possession kicks off the narrative of both FNAF: Special Delivery and Security Breach. Around this same time, construction begins on the Mega Pizzaplex, a massive fun center, filled with arcades and restaurants. During its pre-construction planning, an unknown individual ordered it to be built on top of a pre-existing establishment, Pizzeria Simulator’s Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza Place. You can also see at the end of help wanted when you exit the building you can see the construction off the mega pizzaplex taking place!
            Even, Even more lore
            (Character limit again lmao)

            Tales of the Pizzaplex: The Mimic Epilogues and The Storyteller

            The Tales of the Pizzaplex Epilogues continue the story of the Mimic. A team of construction workers is given the task of clearing Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place of damaged endoskeletons, left behind by Henry’s burning of the restaurant in Pizzeria Simulator. They aim to turn Pizza Place into a museum as part of the construction of the Mega Pizzaplex. In addition to the workers, a unique animatronic, programmed with the mimic1 virus, is part of the crew. It is given the task of removing the heads and arms from the trashed endoskeletons but begins to do the same to the construction crew. Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza Place is sealed off with concrete to keep the Mimic trapped inside.

            Sometime later, a group of teenagers sneaks into Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place, through a vent, and encounter the Mimic. The Mimic utilizes its ability to copy human voices, claiming to be someone trapped in the backstage area of the Pizza Place. When the teens investigate, the Mimic ambushes them. With only one Epilogue remaining, all but one of the teens have been killed by the Mimic in this story.
            In The Storyteller it is revealed that the Mimic1 virus runs the Mega Pizzaplex. It was installed into a large mechanism called The Storyteller, which feeds information, songs, and stories to the location's animatronics. Many of Tales of the Pizzaplex’s short stories reference the Storyteller’s influence. One of the series' most recent entries, Tiger Rock, sees a virtual animatronic emerge from the Pizzaplex's VR attraction and rip off a child’s arms and legs, following the directive given to the Mimic sealed still sealed within the Pizza Place.

            Special Delivery AR

            According to Five Nights at Freddy’s: The Ultimate Guidebook, which collects in-universe files and documents from the FNAF series, the success of Help Wanted led Fazbear executives to explore methods of making the FNAF series a reality. Given the success of the VR approach, they sought to “insert FNAF into the real world.” This led to the Fazbear Funtime Delivery Service, which could send animatronics to people’s real homes to keep them company. However, this work was outsourced to another company, which accidentally scanned a virus into its code, leading the animatronics to attempt to kill each home's inhabitants. Emails between the service's developers and Fazbear Entertainment LLC revealed that Vanessa played a major part in its corruption, using it to collect Remnant, a source of energy used to bond souls to inanimate objects, for an unknown reason.

            Tales of the Pizzaplex: GGY

            Tales of the Pizzaplex features a canon-parallel story in which journalism student Tony hopes to discover the identity of a kid who has risen to the top of nearly every Mega Pizzaplex arcade cabinet’s leaderboard. This player, known only as "GGY" becomes the focal point of a class assignment, in which Tony and two other classmates, nicknamed Boots and Dr. Rabbit, investigate the origin of GGY. Tony discovers that GGY is a hacker who has modified their Play Pass to access employee-only locations in the Pizzaplex. He discovers that GGY has lured others into the Pizzaplex after-hours and that he seems to control the location’s Freddy animatronic, who is now following Tony.

            Security breach

            Prior to the events of Security Breach, Help Wanted’s Vanessa lures all the Pizzaplex’s employees to a staff meeting, promising them a cake. Following this meeting, she is the only employee left on the night shift, setting the stage for Glitchtrap’s plan to come to fruition. However, a small boy, named Gregory, is inhabiting the Pizzaplex as well and allies himself with Glamrock Freddy to survive until 6 am. The two attempt to obtain a series of security badges, in order to access certain exits of the Pizzaplex.

            Gregory soon encounters the Sun and Moon animatronic, with the latter version re-appearing every hour throughout the night, in an attempt to catch Gregory. Gregory also sees a mysterious dancing rabbit, Vanny, aka Vanessa, exploring the Pizzaplex. Despite chasing him in certain areas, along with the locations other animatronics - Chica, Roxy Wolf, and Monty Gator, Vanny's motivations are uncertain. While Freddy can see his fellow animatronics, he cannot see Vanny in his present state, leading Gregory to search for alternative means of surviving the night.

            Gregory soon starts to upgrade Freddy, using parts from the other Glamrock animatronics. He receives Chica’s voicebox, Monty’s Claws, and Roxy’s Eyes, which allow him to see hidden items, locations, and, finally, Vanny. At 6 am, Gregory has the choice to leave the Pizzaplex, confront Vanny, save Vanny, or explore Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza Place, below the Pizzaplex. In the game’s seemingly canon ending, Gregory frees Vanessa from the Glitchtrap virus through three Princess Quest arcade cabinets. Gregory, Vanessa, and Glamrock Freddy’s head escape the Pizzaplex.

            Security breach: RUIN

            Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach RUIN follows a young girl, Cassie, as she explores the Pizzaplex in response to a radio distress call from Security Breach's Gregory. Cassie is tasked with using Vanessa’s discarded V.A.N.N.I. mask to disable the Pizzaplex's security nodes, which have locked Gregory beneath Roxy Raceway. Throughout her journey toward Roxy Raceway, Cassie encounters destroyed versions of the Glamrock Animatronics. Cassie is forced to save, destroy, or reboot the animatronics in order to successfully disable every security node, but is hunted by a mysterious digital entity, taking the form of a glitchy Blue Bunny.

            Cassie’s journey takes her deep below the Pizzaplex, to the basement of Pizzeria Simulator’s Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place. Upon reaching Gregory's location, Cassie must use a forklift to destroy a cement block that has sealed Gregory in a mysterious room. Upon doing so, it is revealed that Cassie has undone the work of The Tales of the Pizzaplex Epilogues’ construction crew and that the radio distress calls were coming from The Mimic. The animatronic was impersonating Gregory, in order to lure Cassie inside Freddy' Fazbear's Pizza Place to free it.

            FNAF RUIN's final moments confirm the Mimic was locked away long before the construction of the Mega Pizzaplex, with the events of both Security Breach and RUIN stemming from its attempts to escape using Vanessa, Gregory, and, later, Cassie to escape. The game’s bad ending sees Gregory explain the Mimic to Cassie, before causing the elevator that she is in to plummet to the ground, keeping the Mimic from finding Vanessa, Freddy, and himself. While some fans believe this voice could again be the Mimic, the game's files confirm that the actual Gregory causes the elevator to plummet. In the game’s secret ending, The Mimic is “scooped” like Michael in Sister Location, and Cassie survives.

            Help Wanted 2

            I’m still looking into help wanted 2 now but here’s a sum of it. There is a total of 40 playable levels in the game. After completing fifteen normal levels, players can unlock more difficult levels by removing a Security Mask, which cranks up the difficulty and distraction in every game. There are a total of 6 Faz Force figures to collect, which will trigger the first ending. There’s also a secret princess quest mini game which connects to security breaches princess quest games. Once again I’m still looking into help wanted 2 lore so this is just the basics of the game
            Even, even, even more lore
            FNAF Movie

            At Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place, a once-successful but now abandoned pizzeria and family entertainment center, a night guard desperately attempts to screw open a vent inside the main office, with something outside banging on the Security Office door. He eventually manages to unscrew it and crawls through to the storage room. He sees a locked gate and tries to open it to no avail. An animatronic suddenly charges at him and and straps to a chair where an animatronic head gets close to his face with spinning blades. He tries to unscrew the chair but only managing to get one screw off before it goes to his face, brutally killing him off screen. The screen then pans to the main area, the lights still on, and then focuses on a picture of a yellow rabbit holding hands with five other children.

            The scene then cuts to mall security guard Mike Schmidt, who wakes up at 6:00AM. He lazily turns off the alarm and puts some pills in the drawer before getting up and doing his workout. He gets dressed and goes to Abby's bedroom only to find her not in bed. He sees her makeshift tent in the corner of the room, with Abby inside. He calls out to her again but she doesn't respond to him. He gets agitated and goes up to the tent, shaking it before she eventually comes out and calls him a jerk. He reminds her that she knows that he has to go to work and to get dressed in 5 minutes, with her responding to him by throwing a teddy bear at him.

            The scene cuts to his coworker, Jeremiah reading a book called "Dream Theory" stating "And though the dreamer remains asleep, he walks through memory as if experiencing it for the first time anew. No longer a passenger, but an active participant." Jeremiah laughs at it, asking if its for real. Mike respond that some people think so and that it depends on what you believe. He then talks about how he wishes he was in that scenario and asks if he could keep it, to which Mike declines and takes the book from him.

            Afterwards, Mike goes to the Ice Cream Parties area and waits behind a lady who orders a "Walnut Fudge but with the fudge on the side so it won't melt the ice cream, as well as some whipped cream on top and three cherries". Mike notices a young boy on the side, but gets distracted by Cindy who asks him to order and asks if he wants his usual to which he says yes before noticing the child getting taken by a stranger. Mistaking him for a kidnapper, he chases after him throughout the mall and tackles him to the fountain, punching him multiple times before getting subdued by Jeremiah. Mike then visits his career counselor, Steve Raglan, for help on a new job. Steve is baffled by his actions in the mall, the guy having been revealed to actually have been the young boy's father.

            Mike proclaims that it was a mistake and a misunderstanding, with Steve Raglan calling out his employment records with him working at "Tire Zone" as a sales associate for two months before getting terminated due to insubordination as well as working at Media World as a custodial staff for only one week before getting fired. He calls out that he thinks he isn't even trying and that it was ironic that he is asking him for help. He says that he is only trying to help and reads out his name before stopping mid-sentence. He leans in for a closer look and suddenly asks for coffee, leaving Mike confused. He pours a cup of coffee and states that his options are really limited due to his bad track record.

            On his first night, Mike falls asleep and dreams about his brother, Garrett's, kidnapping and presumed murder, a dream he had the night before; the only difference being that Mike sees five children who witnessed the crime. When Mike tries to approach them, they run away. On the second night, Mike's dream is repeated, but when he attempts to confront one of the children, he is attacked and wakes up. Mike meets police officer Vanessa Shelly, who notices his wounds and patches him up. Vanessa shows him around the restaurant and tells him that it closed in the 1980s after five children were murdered there; their bodies were never found.
            Jane hires a gang of vandals to vandalize the restaurant in order to get Mike fired, an act which would enable her to gain custody of Abby. As the break-in occurs, the restaurant's animatronic mascots — Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Mr. Cupcake — become alive and kill the gang. Among the vandals is Abby's babysitter Max, whose death results in Mike having to bring Abby to his next shift.

            On the third night, the animatronics befriend Abby, but are hostile towards Mike. He discovers that the animatronics are possessed by the ghosts of the murdered children, whose leader, a blonde boy, consistently mentions a "yellow rabbit". On the fourth night, Abby is injured while she, Mike, and Vanessa are bonding with the animatronics. During her recovery, Vanessa learns Mike is attempting to identify Garrett's kidnapper, and warns him to not bring Abby to the restaurant again threatening him with a gun. Mike gets Jane to babysit Abby, much to her anger, as he goes back to the restaurant during the day and overdoses on sleeping pills.

            Inside the dream, the five children appear again and tell Mike that he can stay with Garrett forever, in exchange for Abby. After denying their offer, Mike is repeatedly attacked in his dream and wakes up strapped to the animatronics' torture device. He escapes by removing pins that the previous deceased security guard had loosened, but is severely wounded by Foxy. A damaged yellow Freddy animatronic, possessed by the blonde boy appears in Mike's house, kills Jane and takes Abby back to the restaurant by hitching a ride with a taxi driver.

            Vanessa finds Mike and treats his injuries; after Mike explains his dream, Vanessa reveals that she is the daughter of William Afton, a serial killer who murdered Garrett and the five children by hiding their bodies in the animatronics, and that their souls are under his control. Realizing that William is planning to murder Abby, Mike rushes to the restaurant with the necessary equipment to disable the animatronics. At the restaurant, Chica attempts to kill Abby, but Mike arrives and saves her. Mike is attacked by Mr. Cupcake and separated from Abby. The animatronics are eventually defeated, but they are reactivated by Steve Raglan, who arrives wearing the "yellow rabbit" suit as he reveals himself to be William before knocking Mike unconscious.

            Knowing that the animatronics need to understand the truth, Abby draws a picture of William murdering the children. Vanessa attempts to stop William from interceding with the plan, but is stabbed in the abdomen. Before William can kill Mike, Abby shows her drawing to the animatronics, and they turn on William. Mr. Cupcake bites off part of the suit, triggering its internal springlock mechanisms and fatally wounding William. The animatronics drag him into a back room as Mike and Abby carry a wounded Vanessa out of the restaurant; she falls into a coma afterwards and is taken to a hospital. Mike continues to look after Abby as they return to their normal lives.

            Meanwhile back in the restaurant, William is still clutching in pain in the back room while one of the ghost of the children closes the door. In the mid-credits scene, the taxi driver that picked up Abby and Golden Freddy earlier is on a break taking a nap when he hears the passenger door open. Initially thinking it's another customer, the driver is shocked to find a Balloon Boy figurine in the passenger seat. During the end credits, a distorted robotic voice spells out "Come find me." (I believe this is the puppet)

            Night 1

            Hello? Hello hello?

            Uh, I wanted to record a message for you, to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you, I’m finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I’m here to tell you there’s nothing to worry about, Uh, you’ll do fine. So, let’s just focus on getting you through your first week, okay?

            Uh, let’s see, first there’s an introductory greeting from the company, that I’m supposed to read. Uh, it’s kind of a legal thing, you know.

            Um, “Welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, a magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.” Blah blah blah.

            Now that might sound bad, I know. But, there’s really nothing to worry about.

            Uh, the animatronic characters here, do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

            So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they’re left in some kind of free roaming mode at night, uh, something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long? Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too, but then there was The Bite of ’87. Yeah. I-It’s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

            Uh, now concerning your safety. The only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won’t recognize you as a person. They’ll pr-They’ll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now, since that’s against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, they’ll probably try to…forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn’t be so bad, if the suits themselves weren’t filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices. Especially around the facial area. So you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort, and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask. Heh. Yeah, they don’t tell you these things when you sign up.

            But hey, first day should be a breeze. I’ll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.



            Night 2

            Uhh, Hello? Hello?

            Uh, well, if you’re hearing this and you made it to day two, uh, congrats! I-I won’t talk quite as long this time, since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses. Uh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone’s in their proper place. You know. Uh, interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn’t come off stage very often. I heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so, hey, I guess that’s one more reason not to run out of power, right?

            I-I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights. Uh, there are blind spots in your camera views, and those blind spots happen to be right outside your doors. So if you can’t find something – or someone – on your cameras, be sure to check the door lights. Uh, you might only have a few seconds to react. Uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course. I’m not implying that.

            Also, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time. The character in there seems unique in that, he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time. I guess he doesn’t like being watched. I don’t know.

            Uh, anyway, I’m sure you have everything under control! Uh, talk to you soon!



            Night 3

            Hello, hello?

            Hey you’re doing great! Most people don’t last this long! I mean, you know, they usually move on to other things by now. I’m not implying that they died. Th-th-that’s not what I meant.

            Uh, anyway, I better not take up too much of your time. Things start getting real tonight.

            Uh, Hey, listen. I had an idea. If you happen to get caught and want to avoid getting stuffed into a Freddy suit, uh, try playing dead! You know, go limp. Then there’s a chance that, uh, maybe they’ll think that you’re an empty costume instead. Then again if they think you’re an empty costume, they might try to, stuff a metal skeleton into you. I wonder how that would work.

            Y-Yeah, never mind, scratch that. I-It’s best just, not to get caught.

            Uh, ok, I’ll leave you to it. See you on the flip side!



            Night 4

            Hello hello?

            Hey! Hey, wow, day four. I knew you could do it.

            Uh, hey, listen, I may not be around to send you a message tomorrow. *door bangs are heard here, and continue throughout the call* It’s-It’s been a bad night here for me. Um, I-I’m kinda glad that I recorded my messages for you *clears throat* uh, when I did.

            Uh, hey, do me a favour. Maybe sometime, uh, you could check inside those suits in the back room? I’m gonna try to hold out until someone checks. Maybe it won’t be so bad. Uh, I-I-I-I always wondered what was in all those empty heads, back there.

            *Freddy’s “Toreador March” music plays*

            You know…*animatronic moan is heard, the same as when you have your monitor up, and an animatronic has got into the room*

            Oh, no – *garbled scream that more closely resembles Golden Freddy’s scream, followed by static*



            Night 5

            With this phone call, Phone Guy does not actually speak. Instead, a garbled voice speaks that is assumed to be an animatronic.

            When the phone call is reversed and touched up, words can be heard against a backdrop of garbled interference.

            Night 1

            Uh, hello? Hello, hello?

            Uh, hello and welcome to your new summer job at the new and improved Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Uh, I’m here to talk you through some of the things you can expect to see during your first week here, and to help you get started down this new and exciting career path.

            Uh, now, I want you to forget anything you may have heard about the old location. You know, uh, some people still have a somewhat negative impression of the company. Uh, that old restaurant was kind of left to rot for quite a while, but, I want to reassure you, Fazbear Entertainment is committed to family fun and above all, safety. They’ve spent a small fortune on these new animatronics, uh, facial recognition, advanced mobility. They even let them walk around during the day! Isn’t that neat? *clears throat* But most importantly, they’re all tied into some kind of criminal database, so they can detect a predator a mile away. Heck, we should be paying them to guard you!

            Uh, now that being said, no new system is without its… kinks. Uh, you’re only the second guard to work at that location. Uh, the first guy finished his week, but complained about… conditions. Uh, we switched him over to the day shift. So hey, lucky you, right? Uh mainly he expressed concern that certain characters seemed to move around at night, and even attempted to get into his office. Now, from what we know, that should be impossible. Uh, that restaurant should be the safest place on earth. So, while our engineers don’t really have an explanation for this, the working theory is that… the robots were never given a proper “night mode”. So when it gets quiet, they think they’re in the wrong room, so then they go try to find where the people are, and in this case, that’s your office.

            So our temporary solution is this. There’s a music box over by the Prize Counter, and it’s rigged to be wound up remotely. So just, every once in a while, switch over to the Prize Counter video feed and wind it up for a few seconds. It doesn’t seem to affect all of the animatronics, but it does affect… one of them. *clears throat*

            Uh, and as for the rest of them, we have an even easier solution. You see, there may be a minor glitch in the system, something about robots seeing you as an endoskeleton without his costume on, and wanting to stuff you in a suit, so hey, we’ve given you an empty Freddy Fazbear head. Problem solved! You can put it on anytime, and leave it on for as long as you want. Eventually anything that wandered in, will wander back out.

            Uh, something else worth mentioning is kind of the modern design of the building. You may have noticed there are no doors for you to close, heh.

            But hey, you have a light! And even though your flashlight can run out of power, the building cannot. So, don’t worry about the place going dark.

            Well, I think that’s it. Uh, you should be golden. Uh, check the lights, put on the Freddy head if you need to, uh, keep the music box wound up, piece of cake. Have a good night, and I’ll talk to you tomorrow.

            Night 2

            Uh, hello? Hello! Uh, see, I told you your first night wouldn’t be a problem, You’re a natural! Uh, by now I’m sure you’ve noticed the older models, sitting in the back room. Uh, those are from the previous location, we just use them for parts now. The idea at first was to repair them. Uh, they even started retrofitting them with some of the newer technology. But they were just so ugly, you know? And the smell…ugh. Uh, so the company decided to go in a whole new direction, and make them super kid-friendly. Uh, those older ones shouldn’t be able to walk around, but if they do, the whole Freddy head trick should work on them too, sooo, whatever.

            Uh, heh. I loved those old characters. Uh, did you ever see Foxy the pirate? Oh wait, Foxy…oh yeah, Foxy! Uh…hey listen! Uh, that one was always a bit twitchy. Uh, I’m not sure the Freddy head trick will work on Foxy. Uh, if for some reason he activates during the night, and you see him standing at the far end of the hall, just flash your light at him from time to time. Those older models would always get disoriented with bright lights. It would cause a system restart, or something. Uh, come to think of it, you might want to try that on any room where something undesirable might be. It might hold them in place for a few seconds. Uh, that glitch might have carried over to the newer models too.

            One more thing, don’t forget the music box! I’ll be honest, I never liked that puppet thing. It’s always…thinking, and it can go anywhere. I don’t think the Freddy mask will fool it. So, just, don’t forget the music box.

            Um, anyway, I’m sure it won’t be a problem. Uh, have a good night, and talk to you tomorrow.

            Night 3

            Uh, hello hello! See, I told you you wouldn’t have any problems! Did, uh, Foxy ever appear in the hallway? Probably not, I was just curious. Like I said, he was always my favourite.

            They tried to remake Foxy, ya know? Uh, they thought the first one was too scary, so they redesigned him to be more kid-friendly and put him in Kid’s Cove. To keep the toddlers entertained, you know. But kids these days just can’t keep their hands to themselves. The staff literally has to put Foxy back together after every shift. So eventually they stopped trying and left him as some “take apart and put back together” attraction. Now he’s just a mess of parts. I think the employees refer to him as just “The Mangle.”

            Uh… oh hey! Before I go, uh, I wanted to ease your mind about any rumours you might have heard lately. You know how these local stories come and go and seldom mean anything. I can personally assure you, that whatever is going on out there, however tragic it may be, has nothing to do with our establishment. It’s just all rumour and speculation, People trying to make a buck, you know. Uh, our guard during the day has reported nothing unusual, and he’s on watch from opening ’til close.

            Okay, well anyway, hang in there and I’ll talk with you tomorrow.

            Night 4

            Hello hello! Uh, hey there, night four! I told you you’d get the hang of it!

            Ok, so uh, just to update you, uh, there’s been somewhat of an investigation going on. Uh, we may end up having to close for a few days, I don’t know. Uh, I want to emphasize though that it’s really just a precaution. Uh, Fazbear Entertainment denies any wrongdoing. These things happen sometimes. Um, it’ll all get sorted out in a few days. Just keep an eye on things and I’ll keep you posted.

            Uh, just as a side note though, try to avoid eye contact with any of the animatronics tonight if you can. Someone may have tampered with their facial recognition systems, we’re not sure. But the characters have been acting very unusual, almost aggressive towards the staff. They interact with the kids just fine, but when they encounter an adult, they just…stare.

            Uh, anyways, hang tight, it’ll all pass. Good night!
            FNAF 2 Phone guy Transcripts (5 - 6)
            Night 5

            Hello hello! Hey, good job, night 5!

            Um, hey, err, keep a close eye on things tonight, ok? Um, from what I understand the building is on lockdown, uh…no one is allowed in or out, y’know. Especially concerning any…previous employees.

            Um, when we get it all sorted out we may move you to the day shift. A position just became…available. Uh, we don’t have a replacement for your shift yet but we’re working on it. Uh, we’re going to try to contact the original restaurant owner. Uh, I think the name of the place was…”Fredbear’s Family Diner” or something like that. It was closed for years though, I doubt we’ll be able to track anybody down.

            Uh, so just get through one more night! Uh, hang in there! Goodnight!

            Night 6

            Uh, hello hello! Uh, what on earth are you doing there? Uh didn’t you get the memo? Uh, the place is closed down, a-at least for a while. Someone used one of the suits. We had a spare in the back, a yellow one. Someone used it…now none of them are acting right.

            Listen j-just finish your shift, it’s safer than trying to leave in the middle of the night. Uh, we have one more event scheduled for tomorrow, a birthday. You’ll be on day shift. Wear your uniform, stay close to the animatronics and make sure they don’t hurt anyone okay? Uh for now just make it through the night. Uh, when the place eventually opens again I’ll probably take the night shift myself.

            Okay, good night, and good luck.
            FNAF 3 Phone guy Transcripts (1 - 4)
            Night 1

            Hey hey, glad you came back for another night! I promise, it’ll be a lot more interesting this time! We found some, some great new relics over the weekend, and we’re out tracking down a new lead, right now! So, uhhh, lemme just update you real quick, then you can get to work. Like, the attraction opens in like, a week, so we have to make sure everything works, and nothing catches on fire!
            Uh, when the place opens, people will come in at the opposite end of the building, and work their way toward you, then past you and out the exit. Uh, yeah you’ve officially become part of the attraction. Uh, you’ll be starring as…the security guard! So not only will you be monitoring the people on the camera as they pass through – you know, to make sure no one steals anything or makes out in the corner – but you’ll also be a part of the show. It’ll make it feel really authentic, I think.

            Uh, now lemme tell you about what’s new. We found another set of drawings, always nice, and a Foxy head! Which we think could be authentic! Then again, it might just be another crappy cosplay. And we found a desk fan. Very old-school. Metal though. Watch the fingers, uh, ha.

            Uh, right now the place is basically just, you know, flashing lights and spooky props. Uh, I honestly thought we’d have more by now. Uh, if we don’t have something really cool by next week, we may have to suit you up in a furry suit and make you walk around saying “boo!”. Heh-heh.

            Uh, but you know, like I said, we’re trying to track down a good lead right now. Uh, some guy who helped design one of the buildings says there was like an extra room that got boarded up, or, uh, something like that. So we’re gonna take a peek and see what we can find. Uh, for now just get comfortable with the new set up.

            Umm, you can check the security cameras over to your right with a click of that blue button. Uh, you can toggle between the hall cams and the vent cam. Uh, then over to your far left, uh, you can flip up your maintenance panel. You know, use this to reboot any systems that may go offline. Uh-heh. Uh in trying to make the place feel vintage we may have overdone it a bit, heh-heh. Some of this equipment is barely functional. Yeah, I-I wasn’t joking about the fire that’s-that’s-that’s a real risk. Uh, the most important thing you want to watch for is the ventilation.

            Look, this place will give you the spooks, man, and if you let that ventilation go offline then you’ll start seeing some crazy stuff, man. Keep that air flowing! Okay, keep an eye on things, and we’ll try to have something new for you tomorrow night!

            Night 2

            Hey man, okay, I have some awesome news for you! First of all, we found some vintage audio training cassettes. Dude, these are like pre-historic! I think they were, like, training tapes for, like, other employees or something like that. So I thought we could, like, have them playing, like, over the speakers as people walk through the attraction. Dude, that’d make this feel, legit man. But I have an even better surprise for you, and you’re not gonna believe this! We found one. A real one.
            Uh-uh-uh, gotta go man. uh, we-well look, it-it’s in there somewhere, I’m-I’m sure you’ll see it. Okay, I’ll leave you with some of this great audio that I found. Talk to you later man!

            –PHONE GUY SPEAKS–

            Uh, hello? Hello hello? Uh welcome to your new career as a performer slash entertainer for Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Uh, these tapes will provide you with much needed information on how to handle, slash climb into, slash climb out of, mascot costumes. Right now we have two specially designed suits that double as both animatronic and suit. So please pay close attention while learning how to operate these suits, as accidents, slash injury, slash death, slash irreparable and grotesque maiming, can occur.

            First, we will discuss how to operate the mascots when they are in animatronic form. For ease of operation the animatronics, are set to turn and walk towards sound cues. This is an easy and hands-free approach, to making sure the animatronics stay where the children are, for maximum entertainment slash crowd-pleasing value. To change the animatronics to suit mode, insert and turn firmly the hand crank provided by the manufacturer.

            Turning the crank will recoil and compress the animatronic parts around the sides of the suit, providing room to climb inside. Please make sure the springlocks are fastened tight, to ensure the animatronic devices remain fixed. We will cover this in more detail in tomorrow’s session.

            Remember to smile. You are the face of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.

            Night 3

            Uh, hello hello! Uh, for today’s lesson we will be continuing our training on proper suit handling technique.
            When using an animatronic as a suit, please ensure that the animatronic parts are tightly compressed and fastened by the springlocks located around the inside of the suit. It may take a few moments, to position your head and torso between these parts in a manner where you can move and speak. Try not to nudge or press against any of the springlocks inside the suit. Do not touch the springlocks at any time. Do not breathe on the springlocks, as moisture may loosen them, and cause them to break loose. In the case that the springlocks come loose while you are wearing the suit, please try to manoeuvrer away from populated areas before bleeding out, as not to ruin the customer experience.

            As always if there is ever an emergency, please note there’s a designated safe room. Every location is built with one extra room that is not included in the digital map layout programmed in the animatronics or security systems. This room is hidden to customers, invisible to animatronics, and is always off-camera.

            As always, remember to smile. You are the face of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.

            Night 4

            Uh hello? Hello hello? Uh there’s been a slight change of company policy concerning the use of the suits. Umm, don’t. After learning of an unfortunate incident at the sister location involving multiple and simultaneous springlock failures, the company has deemed the suits temporarily unfit for employees. Safety is top priority at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, which is why the classic suits are being retired to an appropriate location while being looked at by our technicians.
            Until replacements arrive, you will be expected to wear the temporary costumes provided to you. Keep in mind that they were found on very short notice, so questions about appropriateness slash relevance should be deflected. I repeat, the classic suits are not to be touched, activated, or worn. That being said we are free of liability, do as you wish.

            As always, remember to smile. You are the face of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.
            FNAF 3 Phone guy Transcripts (5 - 6)
            Night 5

            Hello, hello? Umm, this is just a reminder of company policy concerning the safe room.
            The safe room is reserved for equipment and or other properties not being currently used, and as a back-up safety location for employees only. This is not a break room, it should not be considered a place for employees to hide and or congregate. And under no circumstance should a customer ever, be taken into this room, and out of the main show area. Management has also been made aware that the Spring Bonnie animatronic has been noticeably moved, and would like to remind employees that this costume is not safe to wear under any circumstances.

            Thank you, and remember to smile.You are the face of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.

            Night 6

            Uh hello, hello? Uh, this is just to inform all employees, that due to budget restrictions the previously mentioned safe rooms are being sealed at most locations. Including this one. Work crews will be here most of the day today constructing a false wall over the old door face. Nothing is being taken out beforehand, so if you left anything inside, then it’s your own fault. Management also requests that this room not be mentioned to family, friends, or insurance representatives.
            Thanks again, and remember to smile. You are the face of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.
            FNAF 4 Phone guy Easter Egg
            Yes that’s right there is a phone guy easter egg in fnaf 4

            There is a 1/40 chance (1/200 chance on Night 2 and onwards) for a reversed and low-pitched version of Phone Guy's Night 1 phone call from the first game to be heard as background ambience. It simply plays in short fragments, and will play at either 30% or 60% volume before being muted.

            I feel like this is another massive thing as to why everyone used to think that in fnaf 4 you played as Michael and the room looks more of an office with 2 doors, plus the animatronics exactly appear much like how they did in FNAF 1, bonnie from the left, chica from the right, foxy hiding in the closet, and Freddy having "cues" like his 3 nightmare teddy bears. Plus if we look at the logbook that Mike owns, it said something like "Is your favorite toy a purple phone?".

            I feel so nerdy for pointing this out even though I’m pretty sure most of the fandom knows this.

            Night 1

            Welcome to the first day of your exciting new career. Whether you were approached at a job fair, read our ad in Screws, Bolts and Hairpins, or if this is the result of a dare, we welcome you. I will be your personal guide to help you get started. I’m a model 5 of the Handyman’s Robotics and Unit-Repair System, but you can call me Hand-Unit. Your new career promises challenge, intrigue and endless janitorial opportunities.
            Please enter your name as seen above the keypad. This cannot be changed later so please be careful

            It seems that you had some trouble with the keypad. I see what you were trying to type, and I will auto-correct it for you. One moment. Welcome:

            Eggs Benedict.

            You can now open the elevator using that bright, red and obvious button. Let’s get to work!

            Allow me to fill this somewhat frightening silence with some light-hearted banter. Due to the massive success and even more-so the unfortunate closing of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, it was clear that the stage was set – no pun intended – for another contender in children’s entertainment. Unlike most entertainment venues, our robotic entertainers are rented out for private parties during the day, and it’s your job to get the robots back in proper working order before the following morning.

            You are now in the Primary Control Module. It’s actually a crawlspace between the two front showrooms. Now, lets get started with your daily tasks. View the window to your left. This is the Ballora Gallery Party Room and Dance Studio, encouraging kids to get fit and enjoy pizza. Let’s turn on the light and see if Ballora is on stage. Press the blue button on the elevated keypad to your left.

            Uh-oh, it looks like Ballora doesn’t feel like dancing. Let’s give her some motivation. Press the red button now to administer a controlled shock. Maybe that will put a spring back in her step.

            Let’s check the light again.

            Excellent. Ballora is feeling like her old self again and will be ready to perform again tomorrow. Now, view the window to your right. This is the Funtime Auditorium, where Funtime Foxy encourages kids to play and share. Try the light, let’s see what Funtime Foxy is up to.

            On the other side of the glass is Circus Baby’s Auditorium. Let’s check the light, and see what Baby is up to.

            Looks like a few of the lights are out, but we can fix that later. Let’s encourage Baby to cheer up with a controlled shock.

            Circus Baby had a busy day today! Let’s check the light, and make sure she’s in proper working order.

            Oh Circus Baby, we aren’t here to play hide and seek. Let’s encourage baby to come out of hiding with a controlled shock.

            Let’s try another controlled shock.

            There seems to be a power malfunction that is affecting our ability to properly motivate Baby. Please stand by, while I reboot the system. I will be offline momentarily during this process. Various other systems may be offline as well, such as security doors, vent locks and oxygen. Commencing system restart.

            Thank you for your patience. it seems that the power system cannot be restarted automatically. You will need to restart the power system manually. Please return to the primary control module.

It is recommended that you stay low to the ground, and reach the other side as fast as possible so to not disturb Ballora. I will deactivate myself momentarily, as to not create an auditory disturbance. deactivating.

            Night 3

            Welcome back to another pivotal night of your thriving new career, where you get to really ask yourself, what am I doing with my life? What would my friends say, and most importantly, will I ever see my family again? We understand the stresses of a new job, and we’re here for you. To help you reach a more stable and relaxing frame of mind, we offer several musical selections to help make this elevator ride as relaxing and therapeutic as possible. We offer contemporary jazz, classical rainforest ambiance as well as a wide selection of other choices.
            Using the keypad below, please type the first few letters of the musical selection you would prefer

            It seems you had some trouble with the keypad. I see what you were trying to type, and I will auto-correct it for you. Thank you for selecting:

            Casual Bongos.

            Now that your elevator experience has been customised to your needs, and your thoroughly relaxed, it’s worth mentioning that due to your lacklustre performance yesterday, your pay has been decreased by a substantial amount. Please enjoy the rest of your descent.

            Due to unforseen malfunctions from today’s shows, your nightly duties will require you to perform maintenance that you may or may not be skilled enough to perform. It became necessary for technicians to attempt to disconnect Funtime Freddy’s power module. However, they were unsuccessful. Allowing them to try again would be an inefficient path forward, as we would need to allow six to eight weeks for recovery and physical therapy. You will need to reach the Parts and Service room on the other side of Funtime Auditorium to perform the procedure yourself. Let’s check on Ballora first, and make sure she’s on her stage.

            Great, it looks like everything is as it should be in Ballora Gallery. Let’s check on Funtime Foxy. It’s important to make sure she’s on her stage before entering.

            Great, it looks like everything is as it should be in Funtime Auditorium. There is no need to check on Baby tonight; please refrain from entering unauthorised areas. Proceed directly to Funtime Auditorium.

            Unlike Ballora, Funtime Foxy is motion-activated. For this reason, it’s important to keep the room dark, as to not accidentally activate her. You have been provided with a flash beacon. Use it if you need to get your bearings and to ensure you don’t bump into anything. However, use it as sparingly as possible. Proceed forward to reach the Parts and Service room.

            Great job reaching Parts and Service! It seems that Funtime Freddy is out of power, which should make your job much easier. The release switch for the chest cavity is located on the underside of the endoskeleton jaw. To reach it, we will first need to open the face-plated. You will need to press the face-plate release triggers in a specific order, and it’s important to be as precise and as careful as possible. Locate the small button on Freddy’s face, just under his right cheek, and press it.

            For clarification, please note that I am referring to Freddy’s right, not your right.

            Great! Now locate the button under his left cheek, and press it.

            Great! Now carefully locate and press the button next to Freddy’s right eye.

            Great! now carefully locate and press the button just above Freddy’s nose.

            Good job! The face-plates should now be open. Locate and press the small button on the underside of Freddy’s endoskeleton jaw.

            Excellent. The chest cavity should now be open. Remove the power module from the chest cavity.

            Great work. You will now be required to remove the secondary power module from the Bonnie hand-puppet. Press the large black button beneath Bonnie’s bow-tie to release the power module.

            Press the large black button beneath Bonnie’s bow-tie to release the power module.

            Great job. You’ve acquired both power modules. This completes your tasks for the night. Please exit the building through Funtime Auditorium, and we’ll see you back here again tomorrow.

            Night 4

            Hey, wow, day 4. I knew you could do it. Uh, hey, listen, I may not be around to send you a message tomorrow. It's-It's been a bad night here for me.

            Please be aware that there are still two technicians on-site today. Try to avoid interfering with their work if possible. Also, feel free to ask them why they are still there, and encourage them to go home

            Let’s check on Ballora, and make sure she’s on her stage.

            Great. Now let’s check on Funtime Foxy.

            Great! It looks like everything is as it should be in Funtime Auditorium. Your task today will involve more maintenance work. Circus Baby had a rough day, and is in need of repair. You will be required to reach the parts and service room by once again sneaking through Funtime Auditorium. As always, please proceed with caution.

            Great job reaching parts and service! Circus baby has been deactivated for an unknown reason. It is your job to ensure she is structurally stable and secured to the conveyor. Our technicians will take it from the-

Rest assured that you will be promptly rescued, fired, then sent home. Thank you for being an employee. We hope that your experience has not been as regrettable as ours.
